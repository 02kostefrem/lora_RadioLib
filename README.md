# RadioLib Development

## WARNING: Here there be dragons ... and work-in-progress code!
Code in this branch is untested, unverified and often incomplete. If you only want to use RadioLib, [master branch](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) is what you're looking for. If you're a contributor (or just curious), feel free to have a look around. Just don't expect the code to work.
